    This option is very useful when you want to do very advanced or plain weird stuff with your submodules from the
    build scripts and Jenkins keep getting into your way. By disabling support for submodules you can still keep using
    basic git polling functionality and just have Jenkins to ignore submodules completely as if they didn't exist.
